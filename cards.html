    <h1>Cards Collecting</h1>
  <section>
  <h2>Personal Connection</h2>
    <p>While growing up I was always a quiet kid, finding comfort in my imagination. One of these ways I passed time was collecting cards. It started with baseball cards when I was around 7 ish. It then stepped into football then Pokemon. I would pretend to have groups and make them fight each other. Now it seems most people who have cards just keep them on shelfs to collect dust.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Throughout the years, the cards themsevles have changed visually most notely but also in distinct features like healthpoints have evolded. It might be a nostalgic factor, but I personally prefer how the cards looked back then over the flashy and in-your-face style the new artworks have. As you can see also as time went on, these cards became "stronger" in the card game. Which is what the next topic is actaully touching on.</p>

  <h2>The Card Game!</h2>
    <p>If you did not know, the cards are actually more than just a collectable piece of paper with images. They can be used to play the pokemon card game that involves a lot of stratedgy and another person of course. With a 60 card deck, you face your opponent and you win the game when you have no prize cards left. These cards are drawned after shuffling the deck upon the start of the match and with your cards you have to use attacks to knock your opponents pokemon out.</p>
