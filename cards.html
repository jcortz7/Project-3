    <h1>Cards Collecting</h1>
  <section>
  <h2>Personal Connection</h2>
    <p>While growing up I was always a quiet kid, finding comfort in my imagination. One of these ways I passed time was collecting cards. It started with baseball cards when I was around 7 ish. It then stepped into football then Pokemon. I would pretend to have groups and make them fight each other. Now it seems most people who have cards just keep them on shelfs to collect dust.</p>

  <h2>My Favorite Type of Cards</h2>
    <p>Throughout the years, the cards themsevles have changed visually most notely but also in distinct features like healthpoints have evolded. It might be a nostalgic factor, but I personally prefer how the cards looked back then over the flashy and in-your-face style the new artworks have. As you can see also as time went on, these cards became "stronger" in the card game. Which is what the next topic is actaully touching on.</p>

  <h2>Current Day</h2>
    <p>Now the card collecting community has shifted. One of the main factors being covid-19. During the outbreak of the virtus the whole world was stuck inside. With everyone having so much free time on their hands the market greeted them. Views in pack openings and card unboxings skyrocketed. Not just this the age range seemed to increase as well. Now there are collectors who start as young as the age of 4! In conclusion the card community seems to be increasing and seems to be as popular as before even.</p>
