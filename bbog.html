      <h1>Key Factors in Choice</h1>
      <p>When ranking each title I looked at 3 main key factors among each Call of Duty game. The first being the zombies mode. Such things As Map size and overall fun are just some factors. The other 2 would be the multiplier and campaign. Nevertheless these are my top 3 Call of Duty games!</p>

      <p>My favorite videogame of all time. Since the launch of this hyped up game, many gamers all over the world have written nothing but great reviews about this game. Released in 2016, the game is still active and servers are being used as we speak. The zombies and multiplayer are top 3 in franchise history. Along with an interesting campaign is the reason it's ranked here.</p>

      <h2>2. Call of Duty Black Ops 2</h2>

      <p>Call of Duty Black Ops 2 was the first breakthrough zombies game in the francise. 2 out of the 5 maps are fun while the rest seem to anger you after 30 minutes. The multiplayer mode is  the sole reason the rank is here at 2 since it was extremely fun. The campaign is the best campaign that I have ever touched in my 12 years of playing video games. This is why Black Ops 2 is ranked 2.</p>

      <h2>3. Call of Duty World at War</h2>

      <p>Last but not least we have Call of Duty World at War. Many older folks seem to love this Call of Duty specifically (maybe because it's old). Nevertheless the game is above mediocre in all aspects. For me it ranks at number 3 since the mechanics are old among many other bland features. It seems like vintage black ops to be, therefore why it is at 3.</p>
